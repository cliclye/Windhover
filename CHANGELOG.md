# Changelog

## Unreleased

### App
- **First run opens Library** (not Agent), remembers the last tab, and defaults the catalog filter to **16GB laptop**.
- **Windows/Mac copy:** badges and errors say 16GB laptop / this computer / desktop app — not “Mac 16GB” on Windows.
- First-launch status says **Starting Windhover…** while the sidecar boots instead of a false “engine offline.”
- Chat/Agent empty states send you to Library when no model is installed; first-reply copy mentions cold model load.
- Catalog: **Qwen2.5 1.5B Instruct** and **Qwen2.5 3B Instruct** (dense, chat after download).
- Trailing-fence cleanup no longer deletes real markdown code after a sentence (smash-fences still cut).
- Download links and the landing page point at `cliclye/Windhover` (old Kestrel URLs still redirect).

### Desktop
- Health probe requires Windhover’s `engine_present` field so an unrelated server on `:8000` is not reused.

### Performance
- **Warm `windhover-engine`:** Chat and Agent keep one SERVE process per loaded pack (KPK + dense). Tokens still stream; the process unloads on model switch, RAM-profile change, uninstall, or idle (~10 min). Cold mmap+init no longer runs every message.
- **Fast / Balanced / Low-RAM profiles** actually set `RAM_GB` (AU on when capped), `MLOCK`, and `WH_SPARSE`. Default **Balanced** on advertised ≤16 GB machines, including 16 GiB Macs (`bytes/1024**3`, not `bytes/1e9`). Chat shows the cap and a profile picker.

## [0.4.3] — 2026-07-24

### Fixed — macOS parity with Windows
- **Mac DMGs now ship sidecars:** `tauri.macos.conf.json` declares `externalBin` for `windhover-server` + `windhover-engine` (previously only Windows did). Release CI builds the engine + PyInstaller sidecar before `cargo tauri build`.
- **Bundled `libomp.dylib`:** Mac engine no longer depends on Homebrew `/opt/homebrew/.../libomp.dylib`; install name rewritten to `@loader_path` so chat works without brew.
- **Torch-free KPK convert on Mac:** same in-process numpy/safetensors Phi/Gemma path as Windows (`darwin` + frozen).
- **HF/tqdm quiet + UTF-8-safe stdio** on Mac packaged sidecars (same download crash class as Windows cp1252).
- **Longer first-launch health wait** on Mac (30s, was ~8s) and broader sidecar discovery under `.app/Contents`.
- Clears quarantine attrs on the engine (+ libomp) at sidecar start.

## [0.4.2] — 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- **Trailing gibberish after answers:** cuts keyboard-smash / code-fence junk after a finished sentence (server + UI), and the engine early-stops when that pattern appears mid-decode.
- **Chat sampling:** nucleus (`TOPP=0.9`) + `TOPK=40`, lower default temp (`0.35`) and max tokens (`256`) so short replies don’t fill the budget with nonsense.

### Performance
- **Spend RAM for speed:** `MLOCK=1` pins full FFN/attn weights when AU is off; larger prefill batch (`WH_PREFILL_S`/`WH_MAXS` 128).
- **Mac OMP uses P-cores only** (E-cores were lowering tok/s); mild `WH_SPARSE=25` on all platforms for chat.
- Greedy chat enables `WH_SPEC=1` when temperature is 0.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- **Chat `TypeError: Failed to fetch`:** SSE responses were missing CORS headers required by the Tauri WebView (UI is not same-origin with `127.0.0.1:8000`). Streaming now sends `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, and the UI falls back to non-stream chat if SSE still fails.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-24

### App
- **Chat no longer hangs on “thinking”:** desktop chat streams SSE tokens, drains engine stderr (no pipe deadlock), and enforces a wall-clock timeout. Stop cancels the in-flight request.
- **Thinking label** shows the active model name (`Phi-4 Mini is thinking…`) instead of “Windhover is thinking…”.
- **Library → More info** opens Hugging Face downloads/likes/params/tags and published model-index benchmarks (proxied via `/v1/model-info`).
- Qwen3/3.5 chat templates use `enable_thinking=False` so reply budget isn’t burned on hidden `<think>` blocks.

### Runtime
- **macOS parity:** OMP thread tuning (same idea as Windows) before spawning `windhover-engine`; silent in-app updates already replace `.app` and relaunch on Mac.
- Engine chat timeouts + stderr drain on stream path (Mac + Windows).

### Carry-forward from 0.3.15
- Silent Windows in-app updates (`/S /UPDATE /R`) and macOS DMG auto-replace.
- **Qwen3.5 9B · engine Q4** (`Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B`) via faithful GDN + gated attention KPK.

## [0.3.15] — 2026-07-24

### App — seamless in-app updates
- **Windows:** Update now runs the NSIS installer silently (`/S /UPDATE /R`) — no uninstall/reinstall wizard. The app closes, upgrades in place, and relaunches on the new version.
- **macOS:** Update now mounts the DMG, replaces `Windhover.app`, clears quarantine attrs, and relaunches automatically (no drag-to-Applications step).

### Engine — Qwen3.5 9B · engine Q4
- **Official `Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B`** is installable and chat-capable via windhover-engine (text-only KPK).
- Faithful **Gated DeltaNet** (recurrent) + **gated full-attention** (`q_proj` split + sigmoid gate), correct RoPE theta from `rope_parameters`.
- Catalog entry: **Qwen3.5 9B · engine Q4** (`engine_path: kpk`).

## [0.3.14] — 2026-07-24

### Performance — Windows Phi / Qwen tok/s (round 2)
- **AVX2 MLP `axpy_i4g_row` / `axpy_i8_row`:** decode was still scalar on the down^T FFN path after the previous IDOT fix; this is now vectorized (shared `idot_avx.h`).
- **AVX2 attention KV:** `kv_score` + `kv_axpy_v` use AVX2 int8 dots / axpy instead of scalar.
- **Dense path:** wire `wh_dot_i4i8_avx` + AVX exact f32×int8 for QKV (`matmul_q_exact_*`) so non-KPK Qwen is not stuck on scalar.
- **Prefill chunk** raised 64 → 80; Windows Chat defaults `WH_SPARSE=25` (set `WH_SPARSE=0` for full FFN quality).

## [0.3.13] — 2026-07-24

### Fixed — Windows tok/s + RAM (Phi / Qwen / dense KPK)
- **RAM stuck at 0 on Windows:** Process RSS used Unix-only `resource.getrusage`, which always failed on native Windows CPython. Now uses `GetProcessMemoryInfo` (WorkingSet). Chat stats also prefer the engine’s `rss_gb` / `footprint_gb` when present so the UI reflects real model memory without inflating it via fake counters.
- **Extremely slow decode (~300s) on Windows x64:** KPK / dense kernels (`windhover.c`, `dense.c`) were ARM-NEON-only and fell back to **scalar** matmul on x86. Added AVX2 (+ AVX-VNNI when available) IDOT helpers shared via `engine/runtime/idot_avx.h` so Phi-4 Mini, Qwen, and other dense packs run at normal CPU tok/s.
- **OpenMP defaults missing on desktop Windows:** Engine spawn now applies the same Windows OMP/I/O env as `coli` (`OMP_NUM_THREADS` = physical cores, `OMP_WAIT_POLICY=active`, `DIRECT`/`PIPE`/`PILOT_REAL`) **before** launching `windhover-engine.exe`, so libgomp actually sees them.

## [0.3.12] — 2026-07-23

### Fixed
- **Windows WinError 267** when chatting: packaged app launched `windhover-engine` with
  cwd=`bundle/engine` (often missing). Use the engine binary’s directory (or another
  existing path) so CreateProcess succeeds.

## [0.3.11] — 2026-07-23

### Engine — Universal Windhover Model IR (WMIR)
- Replaced architecture allowlists with a layer-typed IR (`windhover.wmir` in `kestrel.json`).
- HF configs lower via `tools/wmir/` (Gemma 4, Qwen3.5/3.6, Llama 4, Kimi, DeepSeek V4, MiniMax, Mistral Large 3, plus classic dense/GLM).
- Runtime executes ops by kind: GQA (+ KV share, chunked/CSA/MSA windows), linear GDN, double-wide MLP, MoE-stream markers.
- Catalog installable entries now require a WMIR lowerer + registered kernels (`tools/catalog_engine_audit.py`).

## [0.3.10] — 2026-07-23

### Catalog
- **Engine-truth audit:** only models Windhover can actually run stay installable. Gemma 4 / Qwen3.5–3.6 hybrid / Llama 4 / Kimi K2.x / DeepSeek V4 / MiniMax M3 / broken HF ids are marked `soon` + blocked.
- Ready list is Qwen2.5/3 dense + SmolLM2 + DeepSeek R1 Distill (chat immediately after download) and Phi-4 Mini (install finishes with KPK convert). Same paths on Mac and Windows.
- Added `tools/catalog_engine_audit.py` to verify HF `model_type` vs engine support before release.

### Bugs fixed
- **Windows Phi-4 / Gemma engine prepare:** first chat no longer hard-fails while converting. Convert runs in the background with progress; install fails clearly if Phi/Gemma KPK convert fails; Chat returns `engine_preparing` and the UI polls until ready.

## [0.3.8] — 2026-07-23

### Bugs fixed
- **UI squashed into top quarter of the window:** shell grid reserved an empty `1fr` row when the update banner was hidden. Titlebar + banners are one chrome block again so the app fills the window.

## [0.3.7] — 2026-07-23

### Bugs fixed
- **Windows Phi-4 “KPK convert failed”:** torch-free safetensors BF16 reads were returning flat arrays, which broke Phi’s fused `qkv` / `gate_up` split during convert. Tensor shapes are restored from the safetensors header so Phi-4 Mini converts and chats via windhover-engine without torch.

## [0.3.6] — 2026-07-23

### App
- **In-app updates:** when a newer GitHub Release exists, Windhover shows an **Update** button. Windows downloads the NSIS installer and upgrades in place (no uninstall). macOS opens the new DMG. Also under Advanced → Check for updates.

## [0.3.5] — 2026-07-23

### Bugs fixed
- **Windows Chat `No module named 'torch'` after Library download:** chat no longer routes downloaded models through transformers preview when KPK is missing. Packaged apps use windhover-engine (dense load-time quant for Qwen/Llama/Mistral; torch-free numpy KPK convert for Phi/Gemma).
- **Packaging:** sidecar bundles `numpy` / `safetensors` / `kestrel_pack` for convert; selfcheck covers chat routing helpers; torch/transformers stay excluded on purpose.

## [0.3.4] — 2026-07-23

### Bugs fixed
- **Windows Library download `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'huggingface_hub'`:** package `huggingface_hub` (and deps) into the `windhover-server` PyInstaller sidecar so Install from Library works without a system Python.
- **Packaging hardening:** also collect `httpx` / hub runtime stack; `windhover-server --sidecar-selfcheck` fails the sidecar build if download imports are missing.

## [0.3.3] — 2026-07-23

### Bugs fixed
- **Windows Library install crash:** `UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u2192'` during model download — UTF-8-safe stdio, HF/tqdm progress bars disabled on Windows, and ASCII-safe progress messages.
- **Windows setup “Error opening file for writing: …\windhover-server.exe”:** NSIS preinstall hooks stop `Windhover` / `windhover-server` / `windhover-engine` and delete locked sidecars before copy.
- **Windows app freezes ~1 minute on first launch:** backend sidecar starts on a background thread so the UI window is responsive immediately; packaged startup defers impostor cleanup until after `/health` is up.
- **Windows release CI:** catalog/health smoke uses `curl.exe` (not flaky `Invoke-WebRequest` / `ResponseEnded`); do not redirect stdout+stderr to the same file in `Start-Process`; JSON catalog/meta reads always use UTF-8; WinARM engine links `winpthread` for static OpenMP builds.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-07-22

### App / API
- **Engine inactive errors:** missing binary, launch failure, or non-zero engine exit now return HTTP 503 with `code: engine_inactive` so Chat/Agent clearly show the engine is not active (no silent pretend-success).
- Chat UI banner + status pill when engine binary is missing or the last reply fell back / failed.
- Soft transformers fallback (unusable decode) still works when HF weights exist, but is marked `engine_active: false`.

### Catalog
- **Qwen3 8B · engine Q4** (`Qwen/Qwen3-8B`) — dense `qwen3`, Windhover int4/KPK path for ~9B-class local engine chat.
- **Qwen3.5 9B** listed as `soon` / blocked: official `qwen3_5` hybrid multimodal is not supported by windhover-engine yet.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-22

### Highlights
- **Phi-4 Mini engine fidelity:** windhover-engine now matches transformers quality on math/reasoning while staying faster and lighter.
- **Partial RoPE + longrope attention scale** for `phi3` packs (`partial_rotary_factor`, attn scale ≈ 1.19).
- **Higher-precision KPK quant for Phi-class models** (D ≤ 4096): int8 `o`/`gate`/`up`/`down`, AWQ kept for near-tied tokens.
- Chat prefers accurate engine path for Phi again; transformers remains fallback for garbage/unsupported RoPE types.

### Engine
- Parse `partial_rotary_factor`, longrope `attention_factor`, and related config in `model_desc.h`.
- Apply RoPE only on `rope_dim` with correct inv-freq base and attn scale (`windhover.c`).
- Support int8 transposed `down_proj` (was int4-only).
- Default `WH_SPARSE=0` for quality; Chat sets it unless overridden.
- Multi-stop / denser stop-token handling for instruct packs.

### Pack / convert
- `tools/kestrel_pack.py`: int8 FFN path for medium dense models; `./windhover convert` uses the ML venv Python.
- Phi-4 Mini KPK rebuild: ~4.5 GB, AWQ + int8 FFN.

### App / API
- Cursor-like shell (Agent/Chat/Library), live engine status strip.
- Catalog refresh (Gemma 4, Phi-4, Qwen3.6, …) and incomplete-pack / download UX fixes.
- Engine→transformers fallback when replies look degenerate.

### Benchmarks (Phi-4 Mini Instruct)
- Engine accuracy suite: **100%** on math/reasoning prompts; mean **~20 tok/s**, peak **~3.8 GB** RSS.
- Transformers (MPS): mean **~2.5 tok/s**, peak **~5.3 GB** — engine ~1.5 GB lighter.
- Details: `docs/phi4_engine_acc.json`, `docs/phi4_detail_bench.json`.
